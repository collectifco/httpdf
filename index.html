    <h1>Free Your Website From the Internet</h1>

    <p>You work hard on providing the best content for your visitors, but slow load times, carrier coverage and different browsers mean that you can’t ensure the same experience for everyone. Responsive design can only go so far.</p>

    <h2>Let users use your website even when they’re offline.</h2>

    <p>Why ask users to reload the website when they come back? With HTTP/DF they can download your entire site and never need to load a page again.</p>

    <h2>HTTP/DF Offline CMS</h2>

    <p>Add your own content at any time. Even away from a computer! Just print off the template and add your content with a pen, paper or a typewriter.</p>

    <h2>Works on All Displays</h2>

    <p>From computer screens to ebook readers to printers, your website can be viewed anywhere. Does it adapt to fit the screen? No. But your design will look the exact same, only different sizes.</p>
